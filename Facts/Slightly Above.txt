*Embrace Natural Ventilation
Open windows and use fans to cool your home naturally during mild weather, reducing the need for air conditioning.

*Batch Cooking
Cook multiple meals at once and store them for later use. This minimizes the frequency of using energy-intensive appliances like ovens and stoves.

*Efficient Laundry Practices
Wash clothes in cold water whenever possible, and consider air-drying clothes instead of using a dryer.

*Opt for Energy-Efficient Electronics
Choose energy-efficient electronics and devices when upgrading or purchasing new items. Look for the Energy Star label.

*Mindful Charging
Charge devices like phones, laptops, and tablets during off-peak hours to take advantage of lower electricity rates.

*Set Your Computer to Sleep Mode
Configure your computer to go into sleep or hibernation mode when not in use for a specified period. This reduces energy consumption.

*Control Your Screen Brightness
Lower the brightness of your computer monitor, TV, and other screens. Brighter settings consume more energy.

*Seal Drafts
Identify and seal gaps, cracks, and drafts in doors and windows to prevent conditioned air from escaping, reducing the need for heating or cooling.

*Upgrade Lighting
Replace any remaining incandescent bulbs with energy-efficient LED or CFL bulbs to reduce electricity consumption for lighting.

*Unplug Unused Chargers
Unplug chargers, power adapters, and small appliances that are not in use. Even in standby mode, they can consume energy.
