Plan meals efficiently to minimize oven or stove use. Opt for one-pot dishes or salads that require less cooking time.

*Unplug Fully Charged Devices
Unplug chargers and devices once they're fully charged to prevent unnecessary energy consumption.

*Regular Appliance Maintenance

Open curtains during the day to utilize natural light effectively. Arrange furniture to allow light to reach deeper into rooms.

*Energy-Efficient Workspaces
Set up energy-efficient workspaces by using task lighting and turning off unnecessary devices when not in use.

*Utilize Power Management Settings
Enable power-saving settings on computers, monitors, and other electronic devices to reduce energy consumption during periods of inactivity.

*Consider Off-Peak Usage
Run energy-intensive appliances, such as dishwashers and washing machines, during off-peak hours when electricity demand is lower.

*Eco-Friendly Landscaping
Use solar-powered outdoor lights or LED bulbs for outdoor lighting to minimize energy consumption.

*Minimize Refrigerator Openings
Organize your fridge so you can quickly grab items without keeping the door open for too long, reducing cold air loss.

*Engage in Device-Free Activities
Dedicate regular times for device-free activities like reading, playing board games, or enjoying outdoor activities to reduce screen-related energy consumption.
