*Unplug Chargers and Devices
Unplug chargers for phones, laptops, and other devices when they're not actively charging. This prevents energy wastage from standby power consumption.

*Optimize Refrigerator Use
Keep your refrigerator and freezer well-organized so you can access items quickly without leaving the door open for extended periods. This reduces the amount of cold air lost.

*Run Appliances Efficiently
Use the appropriate load settings for washing machines and dishwashers. Opt for shorter cycles when possible, as longer cycles consume more electricity.

*Limit Oven Preheating
Preheating the oven is necessary for some dishes, but for others, it might not be essential. Avoid excessive preheating to save energy.

*Use Microwave and Toaster Oven
For small cooking tasks, like reheating leftovers or baking small items, use a microwave or toaster oven instead of the larger stove or oven.

*Turn Off Lights
Develop a habit of turning off lights when leaving a room. This simple practice can significantly reduce unnecessary electricity consumption.

*Use Timers and Power Strips
Set timers on lights and use power strips for electronics. This helps ensure that devices are automatically turned off when not needed and eliminates standby energy use.

*Opt for Energy-Efficient Computers
Choose energy-efficient computer monitors, laptops, and desktops. Enable power-saving features and remember to shut down or put them to sleep when not in use.

*Upgrade Insulation
Ensure your home is well-insulated. Proper insulation helps maintain indoor temperatures, reducing the need for heating or cooling and subsequently lowering electricity use.

*Invest in Smart Plugs
Use smart plugs to control appliances remotely. You can turn off devices that are accidentally left on or schedule them to operate during off-peak hours.
